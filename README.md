Flow Control Statements
Objectives:
Understand the basic concepts and can use flow controls in Java.
Lab Guide 1: IF..ELSE
Specifications                
Create a new package name exercise.ifelse and write a program called CheckPassFail allows entering a value for “mark”, after that prints "PASS" if the int variable "mark" is more than or equal to 50; or prints "FAIL" otherwise. The program shall always print “CHECK DONE” before exiting.

Lab Guide 2: IF..ELSE
Specifications                
Create a new class called CheckOddEven, the required to enter a value for variable number, after that prints "Odd Number" if the int variable “number” is odd, or “Even Number” otherwise. The program shall always print “Bye!” before exiting.

Lab Guide 3: FOR
Specifications                
Create a new package name exercise.forloop.
Write a program called AverageArray to initialization an int array, after that found average of this array and display the average.

Lab Guide 4: FOR
Specifications                
Write a program that sums the first 100 positive integers.

Lab Guide 5: FOR
Specifications
Write a program called HarmonicSum to compute the sum of a harmonic series, as shown below, where n=50000. The program shall compute the sum from left-to-right as well as from the right-to-left. Are the two sums the same? Obtain the absolute difference between these two sums and explain the difference. Which sum is more accurate?.

Lab Guide 6: WHILE
Specifications
Write a program called Fibonacci to print the first 20 Fibonacci numbers F(n), where F(n)=F(n–1)+F(n–2) and F(1)=F(2)=1. Also compute their average. The output shall look like:
The first 20 Fibonacci numbers are:1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597 2584 4181 6765The average is 885.5
